      "The Bluetooth® Low Energy Primer has been created to help technology professionals such as \n",
      "product designers and developers to quickly learn about Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) before \n",
      "consulting the formal technical specifications and delving more deeply into the subject. \n",
      "There exists a substantial collection of specifications, papers and other educational resources about \n",
      "Bluetooth LE available from the Bluetooth SIG. A further aim of this paper is to raise awareness of \n",
      "their existence, their purpose and to help the reader get orientated with the subject and its \n",
      "supporting material.\n",
      "The greater majority of Bluetooth LE products either use a combination of connectionless \n",
      "communication (advertising) and point-to-point connections to exchange data or they communicate \n",
      "only by broadcasting advertising packets. This resource covers the Bluetooth LE stack as it is used for \n",
      "products that fall into these categories. In contrast, Bluetooth mesh is not covered here. Bluetooth \n",
      "mesh is a specialised use of Bluetooth LE about which other information resources should be \n",
      "consulted\n",
      "The motivation for producing this paper was the emergence of the new Bluetooth LE audio standard, \n",
      "LE Audio. Until this time, all Bluetooth audio products used the older Bluetooth technology, \n",
      "Bluetooth BR/EDR which is also known as Bluetooth Classic. It is possible that the advent of LE Audio \n",
      "means that there are numerous seasoned professionals with extensive experience of Bluetooth \n",
      "Classic and its use in audio products, who now find themselves needing to learn quickly about \n",
      "Bluetooth LE. This paper was created with such people in mind but is not exclusively for them. If \n",
      "you’re simply new to Bluetooth LE and want to learn, you should find the paper equally useful. Don’t \n",
      "be surprised to find an audio slant here and there though. You know the reason for this now.\n",
      "It is not the aim of this paper to reproduce or cover precisely the same ground as the formal \n",
      "specifications or to the same depth. From time to time, brief extracts from the specifications may be \n",
      "included where it makes sense to do so. You should think of this paper as serving to orientate by \n",
      "introducing and explaining important Bluetooth LE concepts, pointing the way to other resources \n",
      "and specifications and hopefully, making the learning curve that little bit less steep.\n",
      " \n",
      "3. Introduction \n",
      "Bluetooth technology has been around since the year 2000. Initially created to allow two devices to \n",
      "exchange data wirelessly without the need for any other intermediate networking equipment it \n",
      "quickly found a role in products such as wireless mice and hands-free kits for cars. The latter is an \n",
      "audio product and audio proved to be the killer app for this original version of Bluetooth technology. \n",
      "It continued to be so for many years.\n",
      "This first version of Bluetooth technology, used in those very first ever Bluetooth products is known \n",
      "more formally as Bluetooth BR (Basic Rate). It offered a raw data rate at the physical layer of 1 \n",
      "million bits per second (1 mb/s).\n",
      "Later, a faster version of Bluetooth technology known as Bluetooth BR/EDR (Enhanced Data Rate) \n",
      "was defined. It offered a raw data rate of 2 mb/s but was still designed for use cases involving two \n",
      "devices exchanging data directly between them.\n",
      "Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) first materialized in version 4.0 of the Bluetooth Core Specification1\n",
      ". This \n",
      "was a new version of Bluetooth technology which rather than replace its predecessor, Bluetooth \n",
      "BR/EDR, sat alongside it as an alternative with capabilities and qualities that made it perfect for a \n",
      "new generation of products and the ability to meet new and challenging technical and functional \n",
      "requirements. \n",
      "Bluetooth LE supports topologies other than point to point communication between two devices\n",
      "with a broadcast mode which allows one device to transmit data to an unlimited number of \n",
      "receivers simultaneously. It is also the foundation of Bluetooth mesh networking which allows \n",
      "networks of tens of thousands of devices to be created, each one able to communicate with any \n",
      "other device in the network. \n",
      "One-to-one communication between two devices is supported by both connection-oriented \n",
      "communication and connectionless communication. One-to-many communication is supported by \n",
      "connectionless broadcasting.\n",
      "One of the original design goals for this new Bluetooth technology variant was to be highly efficient \n",
      "in its use of power. Devices which ran off small, coin-sized batteries for days or weeks or more were \n",
      "envisaged and that drive for energy efficiency explains many of the defining characteristics of \n",
      "Bluetooth LE. In particular, the design assigns asymmetrical capabilities and responsibilities to \n",
      "devices, seeking to ensure that devices with a relatively plentiful source of power such as a large \n",
      "smartphone battery do more of the heavy lifting than peer devices running on coin cell batteries. \n",
      "This and other design decisions like it made Bluetooth LE the low power wireless communications \n",
      "technology that it is and positioned it for widespread adoption in a multitude of types of product in \n",
      "the years that would follow. \n",
      " \n",
      "1 The Bluetooth specifications are introduced in section 4\n",
      "4. The Bluetooth LE Specifications \n",
      "A deep and thorough understanding of Bluetooth LE requires intimate familiarity with the applicable \n",
      "specifications. The architecture, procedures and protocols of Bluetooth LE are defined in full by one \n",
      "key specification called the Bluetooth Core Specification. How products use Bluetooth such that they \n",
      "are interoperable is covered by collections of specifications of two special types known as profiles\n",
      "and services. Figure 1 illustrates the Bluetooth LE specification types and their relationships.\n",
      "Figure 1 - The Bluetooth LE specifications\n",
      "4.1 The Bluetooth Core Specification\n",
      "The Bluetooth Core Specification is the primary specification for both Bluetooth LE and Bluetooth \n",
      "Classic. It defines the architecture of the technology and its layers, it describes and defines its key \n",
      "features and it defines the formal procedures underpinning important operations and the protocols \n",
      "with which devices can communicate at a given layer of the stack. It is a necessarily large \n",
      "specification.\n",
      "The Bluetooth Core Specification defines how Bluetooth technology works and the requirements for \n",
      "developers when implementing a Bluetooth stack or one or more of its features.\n",
      "4.2 Profile Specifications\n",
      "When two Bluetooth LE devices are communicating over a connection, it is usually the case that a \n",
      "client / server relationship has been formed. Servers contain state data and clients use that data in \n",
      "some way. \n",
      "Consider a Bluetooth key fob whose purpose is to help you find your keys after you’ve put them \n",
      "down somewhere and temporarily lost them. A smartwatch might act as the client device and the\n",
      "Bluetooth key fob would act as the server. Pressing a button on the smartwatch’s display could \n",
      "cause the key fob’s state to be changed and it to make a loud noise in response to this change so \n",
      "that you can find your keys again. \n",
      "Profile specifications define the roles that related devices (like the smartwatch and key fob) assume \n",
      "and in particular, define the behaviour of the client device and the data on the connected server that \n",
      "it should work with. \n",
      "In the key finder example, the behaviour of the smartwatch or some other device assuming the \n",
      "same role is defined in the Find Me Profile specification. \n",
      "4.3 Service Specifications\n",
      "State data on servers resides in formally defined data items known as characteristics and \n",
      "descriptors2\n",
      ". Characteristics and descriptors are grouped inside constructs known as services. \n",
      "Services provide a context within which to assign meaning and behaviours to the characteristics and \n",
      "descriptors that they contain.\n",
      "A service specification defines a single service along with the characteristics and descriptors that it \n",
      "contains. The behaviours to be exhibited by the device hosting the service in response to various \n",
      "conditions and state data values are defined in the service specification.\n",
      "A service specification can be thought of as defining one aspect of a server device’s behaviour. \n",
      "In the smartwatch and key fob example, the key fob, is acting as a server and implements the \n",
      "Immediate Alert Service. \n",
      "4.4 Assigned Numbers\n",
      "Various aspects of Bluetooth LE make use of unique identifiers. For example, all services, \n",
      "characteristics and descriptors have a universally unique identifier (UUID) which identifies the type\n",
      "of the service, characteristic or descriptor to which it relates rather than a particular instance on a \n",
      "particular device. A company may be identified by a unique company identifier, something which is \n",
      "required by certain profiles.\n",
      "Identifiers allocated by the Bluetooth SIG are known as assigned numbers and a full list of such \n",
      "identifiers can be obtained from the Assigned Numbers page on the Bluetooth SIG website.\n",
      " \n",
      "2 Services, characteristics and descriptors are explained in the Generic Attribute Profile section\n",
      "5. The Bluetooth LE Stack \n",
      "5.1 High-Level Architecture\n",
      "The Bluetooth LE stack consists of a number of layers and functional modules, some of which are \n",
      "mandatory and some of which are optional. These parts of the stack are distributed across two \n",
      "major architectural blocks known as the host and the controller and a standard logical interface \n",
      "defines a way in which these two components may communicate. \n",
      "The host is often something like an operating system. The controller is often a system on a chip. This \n",
      "is not necessarily the case however and the Bluetooth specifications do not mandate any such \n",
      "implementation details. What’s important is that the host and controller act as separate logical \n",
      "containers in the architecture which may be implemented in physically separate components in \n",
      "some way, with a standard interface defined for communication between them. This allows a \n",
      "Bluetooth system to consist of host and controller components from different manufacturers.\n",
      "Figure 2 illustrates the Bluetooth LE stack, its layers and their distribution across the host and \n",
      "controller components.\n",
      "The Host Controller Interface (HCI) indicates the logical interface between them but is not a physical \n",
      "component as such. HCI can be implemented in a number of different ways in terms of the \n",
      "underlying physical transport but the logical or functional interface is always the same.\n",
      "LC3 is the Low Complexity Communication Codec, the default audio codec used with Bluetooth LE \n",
      "Audio. It is not part of the standard Bluetooth LE stack as such but will always be found in LE Audio \n",
      "products, with the LC3 component either implemented in the host or in the controller as shown.\n",
      "Figure 3 illustrates the standard OSI reference model for communications systems. It should be \n",
      "noted that the Bluetooth LE stack spans all layers of the OSI reference model in contrast to many \n",
      "other wireless systems which span a subset of the OSI layers only, such as the physical and data link \n",
      "layers. One advantage that Bluetooth technology has through being a full stack communication \n",
      "system is that there are no external dependencies on other standards bodies. Such dependencies \n",
      "can constrain the evolution of a technology. \n",
      "Figure 2 - The Bluetooth LE stack Figure 3 - The OSI Reference Model\n",
      "Bluetooth mesh uses the Bluetooth LE controller with link layer and physical layer whilst the host \n",
      "part contains a collection of alternative layers which implement the Bluetooth mesh protocols and \n",
      "procedures. This resource does not cover Bluetooth mesh any further and those looking for an \n",
      "educational resource on this subject should consult section 16. Additional Resources below.\n",
      "Figure 4 - The Bluetooth mesh stack\n",
      "5.2 The Layers at a Glance\n",
      "A summary of the key responsibilities and features of each layer of the Bluetooth LE stack as \n",
      "depicted in Figure 2 is as follows:\n",
      "Layer Key Responsibilities\n",
      "Physical Layer Defines all aspects of Bluetooth technology that are related to the use of radio \n",
      "(RF) including modulation schemes, frequency bands, channel use, transmitter \n",
      "and receiver characteristics.\n",
      "Several distinct, supported combinations of physical layer parameters are \n",
      "defined and are referred to as PHYs.\n",
      "Link Layer Defines air interface packet formats, bit stream processing procedures such as \n",
      "error checking, a state machine and protocols for over-the-air communication \n",
      "and link control.\n",
      "Defines several distinct ways of using the underlying radio for connectionless, \n",
      "connection-oriented and isochronous communication known as logical \n",
      "transports.\n",
      "Isochronous Adaptation Layer\n",
      "(ISOAL)\n",
      "Allows different frame durations to be used by devices using isochronous \n",
      "communication. \n",
      "Performs segmentation and reassembly of framed PDUs or fragmentation and \n",
      "recombination of unframed PDUs.\n",
      "Host Controller Interface\n",

      "Provides a well-defined functional interface for bi-directional communication of \n",
      "commands and data between the host component and the controller.\n",

      "Logical Link Control and \n",
      "Adaptation Protocol\n",

      "the appropriate host component.\n",

      "and the layer above L2CAP.\n",
      "Security Manager Protocol\n",
      "(SMP)\n",
      "A protocol used during the execution of security procedures such as pairing.\n",

      "Defines high level data types known as services, characteristics and descriptors in \n",
      "terms of underlying attributes in the attribute table.\n",
      "Defines higher level procedures for using ATT to work with the attribute table.\n",
      "Generic Access Profile\n",
      "(GAP)\n",

      "Each layer in the Bluetooth LE stack, as depicted in Figure 2 will now be examined in more detail.\n",

      "The physical layer of Bluetooth LE defines how the radio transmitter/receiver is used to encode and \n",
      "decode digital data for transmission and receipt, and other radio-related parameters and properties\n",
      "which apply. \n",
      "6.1 Frequency Band\n",
      "Bluetooth LE operates in the 2.4GHz unlicensed band in the range 2400 MHz to 2483.5 MHz which is \n",
      "divided into 40 channels, each with a spacing of 2 MHz. How channels are used is defined by the Link \n",
      "Layer and the data transport architecture.\n",
      "Figure 5 - Bluetooth LE channels\n",
      "6.2 Modulation Scheme\n",
      "To encode digital data from higher layers of the stack before transmission and to decode radio \n",
      "signals received, Bluetooth LE uses a modulation scheme called Gaussian Frequency Shift Keying \n",
      "(GFSK). GFSK works by taking a signal with the central frequency of the selected channel (the carrier) \n",
      "and shifting it up by a specified amount to represent a digital value of 1 or down by the same \n",
      "amount to represent a binary value of 0. Gaussian filtering is applied to the signal to reduce noise \n",
      "which may accompany abrupt frequency changes.\n",
      "Figure 6 illustrates the basic frequency shift keying process. Note that the amount by which the \n",

      "driven by events of a number of types. Numerous control procedures which affect the state of a link\n",

      "The link layer supports both connected and connectionless communication and deterministic and \n",

      "Much of the versatility of Bluetooth LE is rooted in the sophistication of the Link Layer.\n",

      "Preamble The preamble allows the receiver to synchronize precisely on \n",
      "the frequency of the signal, perform automatic gain control \n",

      "7.4 Channel Selection\n",
      "As described in section 6.1 Frequency Band, Bluetooth LE divides the 2.4 GHz frequency band into 40 \n",

      "Bluetooth LE uses spread spectrum techniques in various different ways to communicate data via \n",
      "multiple channels over the course of time. This reduces the chances of collisions, making \n",
      "communication more reliable.\n",
      "One well known example of a spread spectrum technique used in Bluetooth LE is that of adaptive \n",
      "frequency hopping. This involves the radio channel used for packet communication changing \n",

      "data called the channel map which classifies each channel as either used or unused. \n",
      "Implementations can monitor the quality of communication on each channel and if a channel is \n",
      "found to be performing badly, perhaps due to interference from other sources, the channel map can \n",
      "be updated to set that channel’s classification to unused and this ensures that this channel is no \n",
      "longer selected by the algorithm. In this way, channel selection algorithm adapts to the conditions \n",
      "being experienced and optimizes for the most reliable performance.\n",
      "How radio channels are used will be described further when discussing Bluetooth LE logical \n",
      "transports and their associated physical channels below.\n",
      "7.5 The Data Transport Architecture\n",
      "The architecture section of the Bluetooth Core Specification defines a number of concepts which\n",

      "measuring and recording the amplitude of a signal at regular intervals. The frequency with which a \n",
      "sample is recorded is known as the sample rate. The vertical lines in Figure 33 represent samples of \n",
      "the continuously variable audio signal, represented by the curve. That series of samples creates an \n",
      "approximate representation of the original analogue signal. The more frequently samples are taken \n",
      "(i.e., the higher the sample rate) the closer that approximation is to the original and on reversing the \n",
      "process to recreate the original audio, the better the results and the perceived quality.\n",
      "A further dimension of sampling is the bit depth. The amplitude of the signal when sampled needs to \n",
      "be represented by an integer value. One approach is to divide the range of possible amplitude values \n",
      "into 256 discreet amplitude bands and represent each by a number between 0 and 255. In this \n",
      "scheme, a single sample needs only one byte (8 bits) to record the band that the sampled amplitude \n",
      "value falls within and the bit depth is therefore said to be 8 bits. Dividing the possible range of \n",
      "amplitudes into more discreet bands provides a more fine-grained system for representing sample \n",
      "values and so potentially better-quality results. A bit depth of 24 bits for example, allows the range \n",
      "of possible amplitude values to be represented by an integer in the range 0 to 16,777,215. Each \n",
      "sample requires 3 bytes however and hence three times as much data is produced by sampling with \n",
      "this increased bit depth.\n",
      "Digital sampling can produce large amounts of data. Consider a three-minute song, sampled at a rate \n",
      "of 44.1 kHz (CD quality) and with a bit depth of 24. If we do the math, we find that the amount of \n",
      "raw sampled data required to approximately represent the whole song in digital form is nearly 24 \n",
      "megabytes. This is not something we’d worry about if all we wanted to do is to store the data on the \n",
      "4-terabyte hard drive of a computer but when transmitting that data over any communication link \n",
      "with limited bandwidth, it’s an issue. That’s where codecs come in. \n",
      "Figure 33 - Discrete samples representing a continuous analogue signal\n",
      "8.1.2 Codecs and Frames\n",
      "A codec like LC3 which is used by Bluetooth LE audio might compress raw digital sample data to less \n",
      "than 25% of the original size (but note that actual results depend heavily on the original audio \n",
      "content). This is a substantial saving.\n",
      "Codecs generally work by recognizing and exploiting patterns found in a series of consecutive \n",
      "samples. To give a very simple example and solely to illustrate this principle, if the data set contained \n",
      "a consecutive series of 100 sample values all with the same value of say, 50 then assuming a bit \n",
      "depth of 8 bits, a codec might represent this as two bytes containing [100,50] rather than the \n",
      "original series of 100 bytes containing the list of individual samples [50,50,50...,50]. Clearly, for a \n",
      "codec to work, it needs a whole series of samples to analyze and encode as opposed to working on \n",
      "one sample at a time (not many patterns to be found in a single sample!). \n",
      "A collection of samples analyzed at one time by a codec is known as a frame. Frames have a fixed \n",
      "duration, normally measured in milliseconds and contain a number of samples determined by the \n",
      "sample rate. For example, a 10ms frame contains 4410 samples if the sample rate is 44.1 KHz.\n",
      "Different audio products may use different frame durations. 10ms and 7.5ms are common. When \n",
      "one device is producing audio (the source) with one frame duration, and another is consuming it (the \n",
      "sink) but uses a different frame duration then there’s a problem that needs to be solved. That’s \n",
      "where ISOAL comes in.\n",
      "8.2 Framed vs Unframed\n",
      "When devices use isochronous communication, the frame durations used by the transmitting device \n",
      "and a receiving device do not need to be the same. This leads to two possible situations:\n",
      "1. The frame duration used by the first device is an exact multiple of the frame duration used \n",

      "2. The frame duration used by the first device is not an exact multiple of the frame duration\n",
      "used by the other device.\n",

      "10. The Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol \n",
      "10.1 Basics\n",
      "The Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP) is responsible for protocol multiplexing,\n",
      "flow control, and segmentation and reassembly of service data units (SDUs).\n",
      "L2CAP uses the concept of channel to separate sequences of packets passing between layers of the\n",
      "stack. Fixed channels require no set-up, are immediately available and are associated with a\n",
      "particular higher layer protocol. Channels may also be dynamically created and associated with a\n",
      "protocol through a specified Protocol Service Multiplexer (PSM) value.\n",
      "Figure 42 illustrates the primary L2CAP functions.\n",
      "Figure 42 - L2CAP primary functions\n",
      "10.2 L2CAP and Protocol Multiplexing\n",
      "Sitting above L2CAP in the stack are layers which use distinct protocols such as the attribute protocol\n",
      "(ATT) and the security manager protocol (SMP). L2CAP protocol multiplexing makes sure that SDUs\n",
      "get passed up the stack into the appropriate layer for processing.\n",
      "When an L2CAP channel is handling the attribute protocol, it either uses a fixed channel which is\n",
      "reserved for ATT and in this case is said to be acting as an unenhanced ATT bearer or it uses a series\n",
      "of one or more dynamic channels, each acting as an enhanced ATT bearer. The unenhanced ATT\n",
      "bearer supports ATT transactions executed in sequence, one at a time. The enhanced ATT bearer\n",
      "supports parallel ATT transactions which are executed sequentially within parallel L2CAP channels.\n",
      "See 11. The Attribute Protocol for further details on this.\n",
      "10.3 L2CAP and Flow Control\n",
      "Flow control is concerned with making sure that the rate at which packets are produced by one layer\n",
      "of a stack does not exceed the rate at which a layer in the same stack or on a remote device\n",
      "processes those packets. Without flow control, there is a risk of issues such as buffer overflow.\n",
      "Credit based flow control is one of many possible approaches to flow control. In outline, it works as\n",
      "follows:\n",
      "• The transmitting device knows the capacity of the receiving device in terms of the number of \n",
      "PDUs it can handle without losing data (e.g., through its buffer overflowing). It acquires this \n",
      "capacity information through configuration or via an exchange made between the two \n",
      "devices before data transfer starts.\n",
      "• The transmitter sets a counter to the receiver capacity limit. Every time a PDU is sent by the \n",
      "transmitter, the counter is decremented. When the counter value reaches zero, the \n",
      "transmitter knows the receiver is at full capacity and so stops sending further PDUs \n",
      "temporarily while the receiver processes its backlog. \n",
      "• After the receiver reads and processes one or more PDUs from its buffer, it sends back a\n",
      "corresponding number of credits to the transmitter which uses it to increment its counter. \n",
      "With the counter at a non-zero value, the transmitter may continue to send further PDUs.\n",
      "L2CAP defines several modes of operation, largely concerned with flow control.\n",
      "For example, ATT over an L2CAP unenhanced ATT bearer uses Basic L2CAP Mode, which provides no\n",
      "flow control. This renders ATT unreliable and applications must accommodate the possibility that\n",
      "transmitted ATT PDUs may be lost by the receiving device. In the case of unacknowledged PDUs such\n",
      "as notifications, the transmitting device will know whether or not the PDU was received by the stack\n",
      "on the remote device, thanks to link layer acknowledgements but has no way of knowing whether\n",
      "the PDU was successfully delivered to the receiving application at the top of the stack. \n",
      "ATT over an L2CAP enhanced ATT bearer uses Enhanced Credit Based Flow Control Mode, which\n",
      "provides flow control. EATT may therefore be regarded as reliable.\n",
      "10.4 L2CAP Segmentation and Reassembly\n",
      "Layers both above and below L2CAP are subject to a Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) size which\n",
      "specifies the largest size a PDU of the type created by that layer is allowed to be. For example, the\n",
      "ATT_MTU parameters defines the maximum size an ATT PDU may be.\n",
      "L2CAP itself and the layers above or below it in the stack may have different MTU sizes and\n",
      "consequently, it may be necessary to split some PDUs/SDUs into a series of smaller parts which the\n",
      "adjacent layer can handle or conversely, to reassemble a series of related, smaller parts into full\n",
      "PDUs/SDUs. Those processes, as applied by L2CAP with respect to upper layers is called\n",
      "segmentation and reassembly while the equivalent processes as they relate to L2CAP and its\n",
      "relationship with lower layers is called fragmentation and recombination.\n",
      "11. The Attribute Protocol \n",
      "11.1 Basics\n",
      "The attribute protocol (ATT) is used by two devices, one acting in the role of client and the other in \n",
      "the role of server. The server exposes a series of composite data items known as attributes. \n",
      "Attributes are organized by the server in an indexed list called the attribute table. \n",
      "Each attribute contains a handle, a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID), a value and a set of \n",
      "permissions. \n",
      "• The handle is a unique index value with which an ATT client can reference a specific \n",
      "entry in the attribute table. \n",
      "• The UUID identifies the attribute’s type. \n",
      "• The permissions field is a set of flags which indicate whether read, write or both \n",
      "forms of access are permitted and any other security conditions which must be met \n",
      "for access to be allowed.\n",
      "• The Bluetooth SIG study guide Understanding Security in Bluetooth LE has more \n",
      "information on attribute permissions.\n",
      "• The attribute value field is a byte array contain the attribute’s value. Interpretation \n",
      "of the byte array both in terms of data types and semantics is the concern of higher \n",
      "layers of the stack.\n",
      "The Generic Attribute Profile (GATT) defines how attributes may represent higher level constructs\n",
      "known as services, characteristics and descriptors. Typically, a group of attributes in a contiguous\n",
      "handle value range are required to represent more complex types such as these and the attribute\n",
      "protocol supports working with groups of attributes identified by a handle value range for this\n",
      "reason. See section 12. The Generic Attribute Profile for more information on this.\n",
      "ATT is used by an ATT client to discover details of the attribute table in an ATT server, including the\n",
      "handle values of attributes or attribute types of interest. When handle values are known, they can\n",
      "be used with some PDU types to identify and then act upon specific attributes in the table. For\n",
      "example, the ATT_READ_BY_GROUP_TYPE_REQ PDU can be used to find the handle and UUID of all\n",
      "attributes that are part of the definition of a primary service. A shorter way of expressing this is that\n",
      "the ATT_READ_BY_GROUP_TYPE_REQ PDU can be used to find all of the GATT primary services\n",
      "defined by the attribute table, for example.\n",
      "When using PDUs like ATT_READ_BY_GROUP_TYPE_REQ that support discovery operations, a handle\n",
      "range is specified and indicates the subset of the entries in the attribute table to be searched (and\n",
      "this may be the whole table) and an attribute type to look for. Figure 43 illustrates this process with\n",
      "all primary services being sought and the response indicating the range of handle values containing\n",
      "attributes that relate to the discovered primary service.\n",

      "11.2.6 Maximum Transmission Unit\n",
      "The maximum length of an ATT PDU depends on the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) value that \n",

      "bearer8 being used for ATT.\n",
      "11.3 Transactions\n",
      "ATT defines the concept of a transaction. Request PDUs from a client expect a response PDU to be \n",
      "returned by the server within 30 seconds. Indications sent by a server are expected to be replied to \n",
      "by the client with a confirmation PDU within 30 seconds. Each request/response pair or \n",

      "have failed and no further PDUs of any type may be sent using the current bearer.\n",
      "ATT uses a sequential transaction model. This means that if an ATT transaction has been started, no\n",
      "further ATT PDUs may be processed by the same bearer instance until the current transaction has\n",

      "supports EATT by reading this characteristic.\n",
      "The Client Supported Features characteristic value consists of bits which indicate support or\n",

      "Figure 48 - EATT feature support discovery\n",
      "12. The Generic Attribute Profile \n",
      "12.1 Basics\n",
      "The Generic Attribute Profile (GATT) defines higher level data types based on the attributes held in \n",
      "the attribute table (see 11. The Attribute Protocol). Those data types are called services, \n",
      "characteristics and descriptors. It also defines a series of procedures involved in using these data \n",
      "types via the Attribute Protocol (ATT). Applications typically use platform APIs that are mapped to \n",
      "these procedures.\n",
      "Services are grouping mechanisms which provide a context within which to use the characteristics \n",
      "that they contain and have a defined type. Often services correspond to a primary feature or \n",
      "capability of a device. \n",
      "Characteristics are individual items of state data and have a type, an associated value and a set of \n",
      "properties which indicate how the data may be used in terms of sets of related GATT procedures. \n",
      "For example, it may be defined that a connected peer device can read the value of a particular\n",
      "characteristic but cannot write to it. \n",
      "Characteristics belong to a service. The same characteristic type can be a member of more than one \n",
      "service and based on the different contexts these services provide, the rules for using the \n",
      "characteristic might vary. A service specification will provide these details.\n",
      "Descriptors belong to some characteristics and can contain metadata like a textual description for \n",
      "the characteristic or might provide some means of controlling the behaviour of a characteristic. \n",
      "Characteristics have zero or more descriptors attached to them. For example, GATT defines an \n",
      "operation called characteristic value notification which involves a device sending an ATT PDU\n",
      "containing a characteristic value to the connected peer asynchronously and without requiring a \n",
      "response from the other device. If a characteristic supports notifications, typically notifications will \n",
      "be transmitted either when the characteristic value changes or periodically, controlled by a timer. \n",
      "But notifications will only be sent if the peer device has requested them, and this is done by setting a \n",
      "flag in a particular type of descriptor called the Client Characteristic Configuration descriptor which \n",
      "the characteristic must have if it supports notifications.\n",
      "The hierarchical structure of service, characteristics and descriptors is shown in Figure 49.\n",
      "Figure 49 - Services, Characteristics and Descriptors\n",
      "GATT defines two roles. The GATT client sends ATT commands and requests to the GATT server. The \n",
      "GATT server accepts and processes commands and requests received from a GATT client and sends \n",
      "to the GATT client ATT notifications, indications and responses.\n",
      "Two special services are mandatory in all GATT servers. These are the generic access service and the \n",
      "generic attribute service. \n",
      "12.2 Bluetooth SIG vs Custom\n",
      "Some services, characteristics and descriptors are defined by the Bluetooth SIG and have 16-bit \n",
      "UUID values that identify their type. The Bluetooth SIG list of each defined type is available from \n",
      "https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/assigned-numbers. Implementers may purchase 16-bit \n",
      "UUIDs and other types of assigned number as described at https://support.bluetooth.com/hc/en\u0002us/articles/360062030092-Requesting-Assigned-Numbers. \n",
      "An implementer may define custom services, characteristics and descriptors. Custom services, \n",
      "characteristics and descriptors may either be identified by 128-bit UUID values allocated by the \n",
      "implementer or the implementer may purchase 16-bit UUID values from the Bluetooth SIG. 16-bit \n",
      "UUIDs also have an equivalent 128-bit value in the form 0000XXXX-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB\n",
      "where XXXX is the 16-bit UUID value. Implementers may not use UUIDs in this range other than \n",
      "when a UUID has been purchased from the Bluetooth SIG.\n",
      "A GATT server may contain Bluetooth SIG defined services, characteristics and descriptors \n",
      "(attributes) only or it may contain a mixture of Bluetooth SIG defined attributes and custom \n",

      "GATT procedures covering service discovery, characteristic discovery, descriptor discovery, reading \n",
      "and writing characteristic values and notifying and indicating characteristic values are defined, \n",
      "amongst others. The GATT specification provides a clear mapping between its procedures and the \n",
      "underlying ATT protocol which these procedures must use.\n",
      "12.4 Examples \n",
      "12.4.1 Bluetooth SIG defined attributes only\n",
      "Figure 50 shows an example of a set of services with their characteristics. One characteristic has an \n",
      "associated descriptor. Each attribute in this example is defined by the Bluetooth SIG.\n",
      "Figure 50 - An example set of services, characteristics and descriptor\n",
      "The services shown are those which a device that implements the standard proximity profile would \n",
      "probably have (the immediate alert and TX power services are not mandatory). Notice how the alert \n",
      "level characteristic appears twice, once within the link loss service and once in the immediate alert\n",
      "service. The UUID is the same in each case. This is what identified the characteristic as the alert level\n",
      "characteristic. But the service within which the characteristic is grouped provides a distinct context \n",
      "and the rules and behaviour relating to the alert level characteristic differ across the two services.\n",
      "The service changed characteristic has an associated client characteristic configuration descriptor \n",
      "because the characteristic supports notifications. Any characteristic supporting notifications or \n",
      "indications must have a client characteristic configuration descriptor because its value (which clients \n",
      "may write to) controls whether or not notifications or indications are currently enabled or not.\n",
      "12.4.2 Mixture of Bluetooth SIG and Custom Attributes\n",
      "Figure 51 shows a GATT server with a mixture of GATT attributes defined by the Bluetooth SIG with a \n",

      "13. The Generic Access Profile \n",
      "13.1 Basics\n",
      "The Generic Access Profile (GAP) section of the Bluetooth Core Specification defines procedures \n",
      "concerned with device discovery and establishing connections between two devices. How to \n",
      "perform connectionless communication of data in general, how to use periodic advertising (see 7.7.3 \n",
      "PADVB - LE Periodic Advertising Broadcast) and how to set up isochronous communication (see 7.7.5 \n",
      "LE BIS and LE CIS - Isochronous Communication) are also topics covered by GAP.\n",
      "In addition, some key user interface standards and certain aspects of Bluetooth LE security are also \n",
      "covered by this section of the core specification.\n",
      "The transmission of advertising packets (advertising) and their receipt through scanning is at the \n",
      "heart of how much of GAP works. There are a number of different advertising and scanning packet \n",
      "types and these are defined by the link layer. It should be noted that the payload field is called \n",
      "AdvData and that this field is not present in all PDU types. When it is present, data that it contains is \n",
      "encoded as a series of one or more length/tag/value constructs known as AD Types. AD Types are \n",
      "defined in the Core Specification Supplement (CSS) document, available from the specifications page \n",
      "at bluetooth.com. \n",
      "GAP has relevance to both Bluetooth LE and Bluetooth BR/EDR. In the remainder of this section only \n",
      "GAP as it applies to Bluetooth LE is covered. Furthermore, it should be noted that whilst activities \n",
      "like advertising and scanning are of central relevance to GAP, these procedures are actually \n",
      "performed by the link layer as are the PDU types involved.\n",
      "13.2 Roles\n",
      "GAP defines four device roles. These are listed and explained in Table 7.\n",
      "Role Description\n",
      "Broadcaster A device which uses some form of advertising to transmit data in a \n",
      "connectionless manner. This includes legacy advertising, extended advertising \n",
      "and periodic advertising. A broadcaster may also transmit a broadcast \n",
      "isochronous stream. A broadcaster has a transmitter but possessing a receiver \n",
      "is optional. A broadcaster does not accept connections from Central devices \n",
      "(unless it is also acting in the Peripheral role).\n",
      "Observer An Observer receives advertising packets or broadcast isochronous stream \n",
      "data packets. It does not connect to other devices, contains a receiver and may \n",
      "or may not contain a transmitter. The Observer is able to receive broadcast \n",
      "data in a connectionless manner.\n",
      "Peripheral A Peripheral can be connected to by a Central device. It contains a transmitter \n",
      "and a receiver.\n",
      "Central A Central is able to initiate the establishment of a connection with a Peripheral \n",
      "device. It contains both a transmitter and a receiver.\n",
      "Table 7 - GAP roles\n",
      "Note that the role names Central and Peripheral are also used by the link layer. The terms in each of \n",
      "these two different contexts do not mean the same thing.\n",
      "13.3 Discovery\n",
      "A Broadcaster or Peripheral device is either in the non-discoverable mode or it is in one of the two\n",
      "discoverable modes that GAP defines. When advertising in non-discoverable mode, transmitted \n",
      "packets are visible over the air (this is not a security feature) but scanning devices performing either \n",
      "the General Discoverable procedure or the Limited Discoverable procedure will ignore these packets.\n",
      "A discoverable device may either be in the general discoverable mode or the limited discoverable\n",
      "mode. When in the general discoverable mode, a device is discoverable for an indefinite amount of \n",
      "time whereas in the limited discoverable mode it is discoverable for a maximum of three minutes. \n",
      "Discovering devices are able to recognize which of the discoverable modes an advertising device is in \n",
      "by examining an AD Type in the AdvData field called Flags. Limited discoverable mode is often used \n",
      "to give priority to devices the user has recently interacted with, perhaps pressing a button or simply \n",
      "picking up and moving the device.\n",
      "When a Central or Observer devices attempts to discover other devices, it may use either passive \n",
      "scanning or active scanning. Which of the two are permitted depends on whether the device is \n",
      "attempting to discover devices in general discoverable mode or limited discoverable mode.\n",
      "Passive scanning involves receiving advertising PDUs without sending any scanning PDUs. Active \n",
      "scanning involves receiving advertising PDUs and requesting more information in response by \n",
      "sending scanning PDUs. The various PDU types are defined by the link layer and are summarized in \n",
      "7.7.2 ADVB - LE Advertising Broadcast.\n",
      "The Bluetooth Core Specification notes that some devices only use legacy advertising whereas \n",
      "others might use extended advertising or interleave both forms of advertising. It is recommended \n",
      "that devices performing one of the discovery procedures interleave scanning for both types of \n",
      "advertising. It is also recommended that a device scan on all PHYs that it supports.\n",
      "Figure 52 shows GAP discovery modes in conjunction with other relevant variables.\n",
      "13.4 Connection Modes\n",
      "An advertising device can indicate whether or not it is available to be connected to either by the PDU \n",
      "used (legacy advertising) or the value of the AdvMode field (extended advertising).\n",
      "Figure 52 shows GAP connection modes in conjunction with other relevant variables.\n",
      "A device may request a connection with another device by performing one of the connection-related \n",
      "procedures defined by GAP. This will generally involve sending either a CONNECT_IND PDU (legacy \n",
      "advertising) or a AUX_CONNEXT_REQ PDU (extended advertising) as a response to a received PDU of \n",
      "one of several types that permit this. The link layer defines advertising and connection request PDU \n",
      "types and the rules regarding the PDU types for which a connection request may be sent in \n",
      "response. See 7.7.2.2.3 Legacy Advertising and Associated PDU Types and 7.7.2.3.5 Extended \n",
      "Advertising and Associated PDU Types.\n",
      "13.5 Directed vs Undirected\n",
      "Advertising as used by GAP may either be undirected, meaning that PDUs are applicable to any \n",
      "Observer or Central device that receives them or directed meaning that only a specific device should \n",
      "process such PDUs. PDUs involved in directed advertising include the TargetA field with the \n",
      "Bluetooth address of the intended recipient device. In undirected advertising, the TargetA field is \n",
      "absent.\n",
      "Figure 52 shows directed and undirected advertising in the context of GAP discovery and connection \n",
      "modes.\n",
      "Figure 52 - GAP discovery and connection modes\n",
      "Note that the AD Type Flags appears in legacy advertising packets received in the primary \n",
      "advertising channel. When extended advertising is in use however, the AdvData field is not present \n",
      "in ADV_EXT_IND PDUs received on the primary channels. When Flags is in use with extended \n",
      "advertising, it appears in auxiliary AUX_EXT_IND PDUs on the general-purpose channels.\n",
      "13.6 Scannable vs Non-scannable\n",
      "Certain advertising PDU types are said to be scannable. This means that a device receiving such a \n",
      "PDU is permitted to respond with a scan request PDU of an appropriate type, to request more \n",
      "advertising data. Advertising PDUs are defined by the link layer. See 7.7.2.2.3 Legacy Advertising and \n",
      "Associated PDU Types and 7.7.2.3.5 Extended Advertising and Associated PDU Types for details.\n",
      "13.7 GAP and LE Security\n",
      "The GAP specification defines a number of security terms, modes and procedures. Generally, GAP \n",
      "security procedures involve other layers of the stack such as the Security Manager Protocol (SMP) \n",
      "and the link layer but the high level procedure for using those layers to accomplish certain results is \n",
      "defined in Volume 3 Part C (Generic Access Profile) of the Bluetooth Core Specification, which should \n",
      "be consulted for details.\n",
      "13.8 Periodic Advertising\n",
      "Periodic Advertising is performed by the link layer (see 7.7.3 PADVB - LE Periodic Advertising \n",
      "Broadcast) but GAP specifies the procedure for a Broadcaster to enter periodic advertising mode and \n",
      "for an Observer to synchronize with a periodic advertising train. In addition, the Periodic Advertising \n",

      "Isochronous communication using broadcast isochronous streams and connected isochronous \n",
      "streams is performed by the link layer (see 7.7.5 LE BIS and LE CIS - Isochronous Communication) but \n",

      "of communication.\n",
      "14. The Security Manager Protocol \n",
      "14.1 Basics\n",
      "The security manager protocol (SMP) is part of the stack’s security manager component. It supports \n",
      "the execution of security related procedures such as pairing, bonding and key distribution. \n",
      "The security manager component provides a cryptographic toolbox for security functions which \n",
      "other layers can use and defines pairing algorithms.\n",
